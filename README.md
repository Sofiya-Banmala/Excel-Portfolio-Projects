# Excel-Portfolio-Projects

This is my **Excel Portfolio Projects** repository! It contains various projects built using Microsoft Excel, leveraging different functions and formulas. The projects focus on data analysis, data visualization, and reporting to support better decision-making. 

## Purpose  
This repository serves as a centralized space to store and track all my Excel projects, improving efficiency and accessibility for future enhancements and collaborations.  

## Projects Included  
# 1. **Budget Tracker**
   
This project is a Budget Tracking project which is a simple and efficient tool for managing income, expenses, and savings.

The **Income Breakdown** chart shows how your salary is affected by deductions like taxes, insurance, and superannuation. These reduce your total income, but a bonus adds to it, resulting in your final net income. This Waterfall Chart is useful for tracking budget changes and understanding how different amounts increase or decrease over time.

The **Expenses Breakdown** chart shows how your total spending is divided into different categories. The biggest costs are for housing and food, followed by smaller expenses like travel, fuel, gym, and phone bills. This Funnel Chart helps show how expenses decrease step by step. It is often used to track spending or see where people drop off in a process, like a customer journey.

The **% Expenses chart** is a Donut Chart, which looks like a pie chart but has a hole in the middle. It shows that 94% of your income goes to expenses, leaving only 6% as savings. Donut charts are great for dashboard reports because they look clean and make it easy to compare parts of a whole. They are often used instead of pie charts when you need a modern look with space for extra labels.

# 2. **Australian Housing Data Analysis Project**

## Project Overview  
This project analyzes **Australian housing market trends** using Excel. The dashboard provides insights into **property sales, price distribution, and agency performance** across different suburbs. It helps in understanding how various factors, such as property type, number of bedrooms, and location, impact house prices.  

## Dashboard Preview

## Objective  
The main goals of this analysis are:  
- **Distribution by Property Type** â€“ Compare the number of houses vs. units sold.  
- **Distribution by Suburb** â€“ Identify which suburbs have the highest sales.  
- **Top 5 Agencies by Suburb** â€“ Analyze the top real estate agencies based on sales volume.  
- **Properties Sold Over Time** â€“ Track sales trends across different months.  
- **Price Distribution** â€“ Categorize properties into different price ranges.  
- **Correlation Between Price and Bedrooms** â€“ Determine if more bedrooms lead to higher sale prices.  

## Data Collection  
- **Source:** Web scraping from **CoreLogic** website.  
- **Dataset Includes:**  
  - Property Sale Prices  
  - Number of Bedrooms & Bathrooms  
  - Property Type (House/Unit)  
  - Sale Date  
  - Suburb and City  
  - Agency Handling the Sale  

## Data Cleaning & Processing  
The dataset was cleaned and processed in **Excel** by performing:  
- **Removing duplicates and handling missing values** (e.g., replacing "N/A" in the "Sold by" column).  
- **Standardizing Sale Date format** for consistency.  
- **Detecting and removing outliers**, such as properties listed at $1 or incorrect price ranges.  
- **Calculating statistical measures** (Mean, Median, and Mode) to understand pricing trends.  

## Key Features of the Dashboard  
### 1. **Distribution by Property Type**  
- Breakdown of sales between **Houses and Units**.  
- Helps understand **buyer preferences** in different areas.  

### 2. **Distribution by Suburb**  
- Identifies the **most active suburbs** in terms of sales.  
- Allows comparison between different **regions and neighborhoods**.  

### 3. **Top 5 Agencies by Suburb**  
- Lists the **top-performing real estate agencies** based on total properties sold.  
- Shows the **average price range** of properties handled by each agency.  

### 4. **Properties Sold Over Time**  
- **Bar Chart** visualizing **properties sold per month** (December to March).  
- Helps track **seasonal trends** in housing demand.  

### 5. **Price Distribution**  
- Groups properties into **different price brackets** (e.g., 500K-600K, 700K-800K, 1M+).  
- Shows the **affordability range** of houses sold.  

### 6. **Correlation Between Price and Bedrooms**  
- **Scatter plot** showing the relationship between **number of bedrooms** and **sales price**.  
- Identifies whether adding more bedrooms increases property value.  

## Insights & Key Findings  
- **Most properties sold are priced above $1M**, indicating a high-value housing market.  
- **December had the highest number of property sales** (42 properties), suggesting seasonal trends.  
- **The number of bedrooms has a moderate correlation with price**, but other factors also influence sales.  
- **Agencies with the highest sales have an average price range of $800K to $1M**, showing their market focus.  
- **Units in Auburn have different pricing trends compared to nearby suburbs like Burwood**, which can influence buyer decisions.  

## Tools & Techniques Used  
- **Microsoft Excel** â€“ Data Cleaning, Analysis, and Visualization.  
- **Pivot Tables** â€“ Used for grouping and summarizing data.  
- **Excel Formulas** â€“ Used for calculations (SUM, AVERAGE, COUNTIF, IFERROR).  
- **Conditional Formatting** â€“ Highlighting price variations and agency performance.  
- **Data Visualization** â€“ Bar charts, scatter plots, and slicers for filtering data.
